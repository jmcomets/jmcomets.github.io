title: Waiting for may 2014
---

Recently I've been looking up possible internships for my 2014 planned
internship, and have (I hope) found a pretty cool one. :)

The company is a startup based in Paris, [Fidbacks](https://www.fidbacks.com/),
who's main product is a "trust profile", which they build for their users by
connecting accounts from different websites; running on Rails. Really cool idea
IMO, totally worth checking it out !

I'll probably be working on extending the app's main core, by adding crawlers
to connect with more sites, maybe with some TDD and a bit of views, but the
coolest feature I was told I could end up adding would be a generic crawling
method, using a bunch of machine learning
([noobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)). I've already done a
bit of this for [TESS](http://tess.semsaas.com/), actually __exactly__ this.

Coming up in may !
