title: "Mr Nobody: an introspective on life"
---

I'm writing this after my first viewing of Jaco Van Dormel's "Mr Nobody"
(2009), starring Jared Leto. Needless to say I was touched by the message put
magnificently into play. If you don't feel like reading a movie review, let me
put it simply for you: **watch it and see for yourself**. Before you go and do
that, allow me to address a few remarks:

- I watched it rested, in a calm environment and taking breaks whenever I felt
  like it. I suggest you do the same, this is a movie filled with small
  messages and deep thoughts, you should take the time to fully grasp them.
- I used good headphones and an HD copy. This rule goes for most movies, but
  I'd like to make sure you don't go watching an ugly AVI ripped version of it.
  There are some stunning visuals ahead and you'll be missing out on one of the
  movie's notable qualities.
- I kept an open mind, explanations were coming later on. This isn't one of
  those "handed out script" movies. You have to watch the whole movie in order
  to understand it. And that goes for the first viewing, I'm betting on me
  completely changing my mind after the second one.

Now that we're through with the notes, you can close this page and go watch it,
**spoilers ahead**.

# Introduction: the pigeon's association of cause and consequence

Immediately before presenting the characters and putting the storyline into
motion, we're presented with what I thought at first was the Pavlov effect.
Classical conditioning of a pigeon by having it associate pressing a switch for
rewards. The catch is that when presented with a reward with no obvious cause,
the pigeon will quickly wonder *what did i do to deserve this?*. The analogy
with our own lives is clear, the great question that we ask ourselves after any
trauma.

For reference, the pigeon superstition is part of the works of [B. F.
Skinner][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner#Superstition_in_the_pigeon],
an American psychologist from Harvard. An unrelated but amusing anectode:
Skinner had the unusual idea of using pigeons to guide missiles during the
second world war.

# Plot analysis

Back to our feature presentation: at this point I thought the movie would be
corny and full of déjà-vus. Turns out I was actually right about part of that
statement, but we'll see that later on.

## The mishmash in time and memory

At first we're thrown into what seems to be multiple possible deaths for Nemo
Nobody, either by accident (car crash in the lake), by human hand (shot in the
bath) or by cold nature (asteroid shower). The story now begins with a
centenarian Nemo waking up in a futuristic world. Nemo is plagued with
Alzheimer due to his old age, and people seem to be working on keeping his
memories together before his death.

The story's pace increases as Nemo goes through back, forth...and sideways in
time, living different versions of his life, trying each choice as it presents
itself. Nemo doesn't seem in control: he'll wake up in bed next to his wife
Ellie, look away for an instant and find another woman beside him, claiming to
be his wife Jean. Adult Nemo also suffers from some form of amnesia, forgetting
the name of his son, which could fuel another interpretation: maybe the older
"Mr Nobody" is inventing his long lost memories to cope with his memory loss.
Maybe the contradictory versions of his life illustrate the severity of his
illness and his detachment from reality?

The supernatural origins of Nemo are skimmed through, showing how Van Dormel
focused his interest on displaying consequences rather than causes. Presented
as is, the story of the angels of Oblivion feels ludicrous, exaggerated to
mirror Nemo's parents' view on his abilities.

## Another pursuit of happiness

The plot revolves several elements of Nemo's life

- young Nemo lives a somewhat happy life until an unlikely accident changes his
  dad, causing his parents to split up
- teenage Nemo lives with one (both) of his parents, searching for young love
- adult Nemo tries to make sense of his life, striving to be happy in a world
  definitely against him

These points can be reduced to the simple search of happiness, but the fact
that they are all consequences of previous events separate the film from the
other classic *pursuit of happiness* genre (my personal favorite being
[Life is Beautiful](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/)). Mr Nobody is a film
entirely about **choice**, how they affect us.

## The paths we take, eg. "high on feels"

While the storyline is interesting and the message is powerful, nothing makes a
movie like a deep emotional attachment to the characters. Nemo follows many
paths due to his past choices and finds love in different ways: altruism, art
or just passionate love. He finds himself helpless against the universe's
unforgiving *butterfly effect*, whose consequences range from separating his
parents to losing the love of his life, becoming paraplegic to suffering a
deadly car accident. The message is clear as crystal: **life is short, live as
much as possible**. Old Nemo repeats it himself: *"I'm afraid I haven't lived
enough"*.

# General opinion

The plot and initial setup were a little misleading. The narrative form made me
think *"Oh great it's going to be filled with flashbacks"*; it was becoming
cliché at an alarming rate. Still I always try to get a good 30 minutes into
any movie before judging it.

The psychologist made me chuckle with his ridiculous amount of face tattoos. I
believe the choice of such an unrealistic and inhuman futuristic world was
extremely well thought out. After all, I entire world came out of the
imagination of a 9 year-old kid!

The romance between Nemo and Anne was probably one of the most passionate and
convincing I've ever seen on film. It is by far the strongest emotional aspect
of the film, bringing tears to my eyes when they are *finally* reunited after
being separated brutally...twice.
