title: "Mr Nobody: an introspective on life"
---

I'm writing this after my first viewing of Jaco Van Dormel's "Mr Nobody"
(2009), starring Jared Leto. Needless to say I was touched by the message put
magnificently into play. If you don't feel like reading a movie review, let me
put it simply for you: **view it and see for yourself**. Before you go and do
that, allow me to address a few remarks:

- I watched it rested, in a calm environment and taking breaks whenever I felt
  like it. I suggest you do the same, this is a movie filled with small
  messages and deep thoughts, you should take the time to fully grasp them.
- I used good headphones and an HD copy. This rule goes for most movies, but
  I'd like to make sure you don't go watching an ugly AVI ripped version of it.
  There are some stunning visuals ahead and you'll be missing out on one of the
  movie's notable qualities.
- I kept an open mind, explanations were coming later on. This isn't one of
  those "handed out script" movies. You have to watch the whole movie in order
  to understand it. And that goes for the first viewing, I'm betting on me
  completely changing my mind after the second one.

Now that we're through with the notes, you can close this page and go watch it,
**spoilers ahead**.

# Introduction: the pigeon and the association of cause and consequence

Immediately before presenting the characters and putting the storyline into
motion, we're presented with what I thought at first was the Pavlov effect.
Classical conditioning of a pigeon by having it associate pressing a switch for
rewards. The catch is that when presented with a reward with no obvious cause,
the pigeon will quickly wonder *what did i do to deserve this?*. The analogy
with our own lives is clear, the great question that we ask ourselves after any
trauma.

For reference, the pigeon superstition is part of the works of [B. F.
Skinner][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner#Superstition_in_the_pigeon],
an American psychologist from Harvard.

At this point I thought the movie would be corny and full of déjà-vus. Turns
out I was actually right about part of that statement, but we'll see that later
on.

# Part 2: memories and reflection on life

We're thrown into what seems to be multiple possible deaths for Nemo Nobody,
either by accident (car crash in the lake), by human hand (shot in the bath) or
by cold nature (asteroid shower). The story now begins with a centenarian Nemo
waking up in a futuristic world. The psychologist made me chuckle with his
ridiculous amount of face tattoos, almost resembling the pattern of Darth Maul
from Star Wars. Nemo seems to be struck with Alzheimer due to his old age, and
they're working on keeping his memories together before his death.

I think: *"Oh great it's going to be filled with flashbacks"*; it's becoming
cliché at an alarming rate. Still you always want to get a good 30 minutes into
any movie before judging it.

In the advanced future of the human race, Nemo seems to be the only "mortal"
man left. He can't remember growing old, and believes he's 34.

The others have been "telemerized" and attained "quasi-immortality". Great,
more corny sci-fi terms, this is going nowhere.
