title: Startups: something to experience
---

Well I've just finished my internship at Fidbacks, not crying me eyes out but
nearly. I'm gonna miss a lot of stuff, but the worst will definitely be those
monday morning croissants! :D

It was some experience, working with a week-to-week schedule, sometimes even
day-to-day. I'd always heard about "X startup launched a product which does Y
for Z", but never really got into the innovation business (last year was lab
work, that doesn't count).

**Diving into the startup salad got to me big time.**

So here are a few notable things I learnt from these few last months.

## Make things work, don't compromise

Obviously, this comes first; most of the time I spent at Fidbacks was building
features which were either openly requested by customers or at the top of the
"TODO" list. When doing this, I knew that what I was working on would most
likely be deployed the next week or two, and needed to be pitch-perfect.

I usually could settle with a "it works" version, but by knowing it would
probably be in production on such a short notice, my spirit was filled with
motivation and I needed everything to be **perfect**. Which, in software
development, is a big no-no.

Now this is a well known concept, and you can probably guess what happened.
**Overcomplexity**. More database tables, inheritance, mixins, app-level
libraries and all sorts of other things. Wasted time, complicated diffs and the
very annoying "why did you touch this file?" question when the team leader was
reviewing my PR.

There's nothing like experiencing what you've always heard about.

## Contribute to the software you use
## Use the latest tools that fit you best
## Fear the unknown
## Bond with your team
