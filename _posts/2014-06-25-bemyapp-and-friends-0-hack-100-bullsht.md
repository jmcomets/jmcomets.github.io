title: "BeMyApp and friends: 0 % hack, 100 % bullshit"
---

Back after many months NOT blogging, which isn't really what I had in mind when
I put started building this website. I've got a ton of projects pending, and
can't find the right work-socialize-build-sleep balance. :P

Anyway, I'm **back in business** with this (hater?) post.

As you might not know, I attended **HackAXA** this past January, a hackathon
organized by BeMyApp in collaboration with Salesforce and AXA France. 'Twas a
very interesting experience that taught me a lot about french companies and
their view on software.

Least to say is that companies are making a lot of money having hackers give
them ideas.

More generally, I also had a very interesting discussion with a BI
freelance last week-end. We agreed on the following views of the current state
of mind in french software companies:

1. Presentation is everything: if your software looks good, I can conclude that
   it's wonderful and suits our needs. What do you mean there's no back-end?
   Isn't the front-end the hardest thing to get working?
2. Keywords are the shit. Use as many as you can possibly put that have
   something to do with what you're talking about. That way no one will
   understand you and you'll stay on top.
3. Arrive before 9:30 AM and leave after 5:30 PM, you can't possibly be
   productive if you aren't on the same schedule as everyone else. Oh and you
   don't really need to work during these hours, you can take your
   coffee/cigarette break every hour if you don't feel like it. Or you can
   check Facebook on your phone, that's ok.

I personally find these points ridiculous and counter-intuitive:

1. Presentation is *only* presentation, in software you should be able to
   easily switch presentations **for the same app**.
2. Isn't a company supposed to work together, and help each other? Teacher
   skills, anyone?
3. I get that people need to be available on the phone for their
   coworkers/clients, but don't we have mobile phones for that? Also,
   *obligation de moyens* is a very french concept: don't work to give results,
   work to show everyone that you are working! Really, this just encourages
   laziness.
