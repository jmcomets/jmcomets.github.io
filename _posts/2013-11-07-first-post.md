First post !

Well, since I guess this is gonna be the first of a long series of posts for
"the web", I should probably start out by introducing myself :

My name is Jean-Marie Comets, I'm a half-american/half-french computer nerd (or
geek, or whatever). I like techs and projects, programming (Python <3),
open-source stuff, movies, music, video-games, as well as pretty much anything
science-ish.  At the moment, I'm in my fourth year of engineering school, going
for a degree in computer science.

I'm really active on [Github](https://github.com/jmcomets), and have a few cool
projects I'm very proud of, mainly :

- [tess](http://tess.semsaas.com/), an object-based search engine (written
  during a hackathon -> [FHacktory](http://www.fhacktory.com/))
- [IntoSpectrum](https://github.com/jmcomets/IntoSpectrum), a server-sided web
  audio player

I'm also a very big movie-freak, my top flick being Pulp Fiction, which I think
combines perfectly the ingredients of a great movie, and at the same time has
this unique humor that cracks me up every time. Also Samuel L. Jackson is a
total badass.

Anyways, I'm in my school's movie club (check out the
[website](http://cineclub.insa-lyon.fr/)!-french btw), and we're into all sorts
of awesome/funny/weird/whatever types of movies. Just saying that some I might
post about may not be worth watching, depending on the tone used in the prose
and the IMDb rating...


Quickly finishing this post, I'd like to leave a short note concerning the
"fun" link in the top menu. With one of my current roommates, we thought it
would be cool to setup a mini-game on the website, so that should be coming
around (hopefully)...though I could use some artwork. ;)
