# Todo list

The website is fairly content-focused, and while that's a good thing, it also
makes the blog less attractive. Styling needs to be done to enhance the
visuals, maybe with a cleaner font and a sticky header/go to top button.

Features to implement:

[ ] Title: a better one; "yet another" is ugly
[ ] Cover page: latest posts (~5)
[ ] Sidebar: recent tweets, reads, and IMDb ratings/watchlist
[ ] Small talk: regularly updated with random thoughts (~5 min reads)
[ ] Cinema: page, containing movie reviews and comments on watchlist / ratings
[ ] Programming
[ ] Vim
[ ] Projects
[ ] About
